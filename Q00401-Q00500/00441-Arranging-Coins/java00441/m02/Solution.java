 *
 * 441. Arranging Coins #152
 *
 * You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.
 *
 * Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: n = 5
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: n = 8
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1
 *
 * Time Complexity ï¼š O(min(log66000, logN))
 * Space Complexity : O(1)
 *
 * Runtime: 1 ms, faster than 100.00% of Java online submissions for Arranging Coins.
 * Memory Usage: 36.3 MB, less than 41.41% of Java online submissions for Arranging Coins.
