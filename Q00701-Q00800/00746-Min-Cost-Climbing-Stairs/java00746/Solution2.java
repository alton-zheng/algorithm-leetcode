 * 746.Â Min Cost Climbing Stairs
 * You are given an integer array cost where cost[i] is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.
 * <p>
 * You can either start from the step with index 0, or the step with index 1.
 * <p>
 * Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: cost = [10,15,20]
 * Output: 15
 * Explanation: Cheapest is: start on cost[1], pay that cost, and go to the top.
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: Cheapest is: start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 2 <= cost.length <= 1000
 * 0 <= cost[i] <= 999
