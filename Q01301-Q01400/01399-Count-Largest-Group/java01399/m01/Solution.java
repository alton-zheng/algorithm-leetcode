 * @Description:
 * 1399. Count Largest Group #172
 *
 * Given an integer n. Each number from 1 to n is grouped according to the sum of its digits.
 *
 * Return how many groups have the largest size.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: n = 13
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: There are 9 groups in total, they are grouped according sum of its digits of numbers from 1 to 13:
 * [1,10], [2,11], [3,12], [4,13], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9]. There are 4 groups with largest size.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: n = 2
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: There are 2 groups [1], [2] of size 1.
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: n = 15
 * Output: 6
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: n = 24
 * Output: 5
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= n <= 10^4
 *
 * Time Complexity ï¼š O(N*logN)
 * Space Complexity : O(1)
 * Runtime: 3 ms, faster than 96.48% of Java online submissions for Count Largest Group.
 * Memory Usage: 35.6 MB, less than 87.22% of Java online submissions for Count Largest Group.
